## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt and I'm a Python Software Engineer from London


### ðŸš€ About Me:  

I'm an ex-HGV driver transitioning into software engineering, whilst completing a distance learning BSc (Hons), Computer Science at University of London, with academic lead from Goldsmiths. I've also recently completed a full scholarship software engineering bootcamp.  <br><br>Some of my key skills include:<br>Python: to intermediate<br>Django: to intermediate<br>SQL: (PostgreSQL and SQLite3 in particular)<br>Git<br>JavaScript: to a moderate standard<br>
I'm currently open to new working opportunities, please reach out to me on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/mbutcherdev).

Some of my favourite projects are pinned on this page, but for easy access here's a quick rundown of the projects and why I liked them:
- [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/mbutcherdev/pomodorotimer): I always find myself losing track of time and subsequently not taking any breaks, leading to worse performance after a while. I created this little GUI app in Python and CustomTkinter that sends a notification to the screen and adds a record of your timers to a SQLite database.
- [Password Generator](https://github.com/mbutcherdev/password-generator): Everyones favourite 'first app'. This was initially written using the random module, upgraded to the Secrets module and will get a further upgrade to Fernet for it's encryption. Started off as a CLI based application, then moved to a GUI with Tkinter so it could be used on the go, including an installer. This project is currently on my radar to be upgraded to a full password manager as my skills improve.
- [DriverVision](https://driver.mbutcher.dev): A personal project with real-world application, based on my experience as a HGV driver. Long periods of driving mixed with high-stress and constant attention leads to distractions within the cab. My solution to this is DriverVision. The application itself will be a computer vision based camera with face and eye detection to alert a dashboard when a driver is either looking away (distracted) or their eyes are closing (fatigue). Currently in the planning phase.
- [BudgetApp](https://budget.mbutcher.dev): A group project created with a few fellow developers from our software development bootcamp. The idea is to create a new 'Budget Website' that will allow users to keep track of their income/expenses/direct debits and put each expense into a category. The project is made in django, I'm currently hosting this and have led the main website development. Very early into development, but expected to grow quickly.
- [Sudoku](https://github.com/mbutcherdev/sudoku): An application I build initially following a tutorial and then expanded it by myself. CLI version contains a solvable board and a backtracking algorithm to solve it for you. The GUI currently contains the board in a PyGame friendly playable version
- Y!PP Jobbing Bot: Private repository, contains a Discord.py integrated BeautifulSoup web scraper, to return jobbing numbers from the [YoWeb](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Yoweb), the website is quite old so it was a fun challenge to find the correct data to scrape and integrate it into discord commands whilst storing the data to files.
